# What is toproll


Toproll is a game where users can roll six (very large) dice to try and get the highest score. It has no other function than getting a higher number than your friends and acts as a bit of fun. It was a big hit in a Discord server I am in so I decided to add an enhanced version of it to Casper!

Once a game is setup, all you have to do is use /roll and see if you can get the high score - there's no limitations on how many times you can roll within the 24 hour game time.

To view a leaderboard of all the rolls during a game, it's `/leaderboard me` or `/leaderboard post`

It is suggested that you allow the /roll command to be used anywhere in the Discord as it only shows messages to users
