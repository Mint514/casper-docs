# Toproll setup/disable

Setting up toproll is very straight forward and once done, does not need to be touched again unless you want to change the auto announcements.

All you need to do is run `/toproll setup [channelhere]` Pick a channel that you want the bot to announce the start of the game and when it ends. I recommend using something like general chat. 

To start a game, use `/toproll start` this will send a message to the channel you specified in the setup explaining how to play the game, each game lasts for 24 hours. 

To disable toproll, all you need to do is the `/toproll disable` command and it will stop the game running (if it exists) and stop any new games from staring
