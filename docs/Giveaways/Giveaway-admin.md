# Giveaway Admin

Once a giveaway has been posted, you are able to control it if you have the `Manager server` permission by simply doing
```
/giveawayadmin
```
From here you can select your giveaway from the drop down and do the following

| Button | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `Enteries` | See who has entered 
| `End` | End the selected giveaway 
| `Reroll` | Reroll the selected giveaway

You can only reroll a giveaway once it has ended. Giveaways are archived for 3 days giving you a chance to reroll it if needed, after that they are permanently deleted from Casper.

You cannot edit the winners, prize, description, restricted role or minimum messages once it has been set.
