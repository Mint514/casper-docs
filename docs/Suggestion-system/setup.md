# Setup

Setting up Caspers suggestion system couldn't be easier! You need `Manage Server` permission to run the initial command. To set it up use
```
/suggestsetup 
```

This will bring up the suggestion menu. All you need to do here is set a channel where suggestions will be posted (we recommend a new channel that members can view but not post in) and then click enable. Thats it!

## Posting a suggestion

All users need to do is run `/suggest [suggestion]` this will then post the suggestion in the channel you specified earlier, users can vote for or against the suggestion using the buttons.

Casper will also open a public thread which will allow users to discuss the suggestion.

## Approve or Rejecting a suggestion

You can accept a suggestion by doing `/approve [suggestion ID]` or `/reject [suggestion ID]` this will update the posted suggestion saying if you have approved or rejected it. Casper will also lock the thread associated with the suggestion,
